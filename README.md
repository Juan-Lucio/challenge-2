# 📌 Project Roadmap – JSON → CSV Automation System

---

## 🎯 General Objective
Automate the integration of JSON files into CSV to **reduce manual workload** and **improve the accuracy** of scientific production reports.

---

## 🎯 Specific Objectives
1️⃣ Research and document SCRUM, JSON, CSV, and manual workflow.  
2️⃣ Set up GitHub repository and initial project structure.  
3️⃣ Develop **JSON → CSV conversion** functionality.  
4️⃣ Add configuration options for **flexibility** (paths & fields).  
5️⃣ Deliver final **documentation, demo video, and packaged app**.
