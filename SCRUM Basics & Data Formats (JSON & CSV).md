# Presentation: SCRUM Basics & Data Formats (JSON & CSV)

---

## Slide 1 â€“ Title
**Automating Scientific Reports with SCRUM**  
*From JSON to CSV in a University Research Context*  

---

## Slide 2 â€“ Why SCRUM?
- Not just a methodology, but a way of working in **small, steady steps**  
- Helps the team stay **organized, adaptable, and transparent**  
- Perfect for projects where requirements may change as we learn  

---

## Slide 3 â€“ Key Roles in SCRUM
- **Product Owner** â†’ Brings the vision and decides priorities  
- **Team** â†’ Builds the solution step by step  
- **Scrum Master** â†’ Keeps things flowing, clears obstacles  

---

## Slide 4 â€“ The Rhythm of SCRUM
- **Planning** â†’ What can we achieve this sprint?  
- **Daily Check-ins** â†’ Quick sync on progress and blockers  
- **Review** â†’ Show what weâ€™ve built so far  
- **Retro** â†’ What worked, what to improve next time  

---

## Slide 5 â€“ The Tools (Artifacts)
- **Product Backlog** â†’ The big list of everything weâ€™d like to achieve  
- **Sprint Backlog** â†’ What weâ€™re focusing on right now  
- **Increment** â†’ A piece of working value, not just theory  

---

## Slide 6 â€“ JSON in Practice
- A text format made of **keys and values**  
- Flexible, supports lists and nested structures  
- Common in APIs and modern apps â†’ easy to integrate into code  

---

## Slide 7 â€“ CSV in Practice
- A plain table, rows and columns separated by commas  
- Dead simple, but powerful for analysis  
- Opens easily in Excel, Google Sheets, and BI tools  

---

## Slide 8 â€“ JSON vs. CSV
| Aspect      | JSON | CSV |
|-------------|------|-----|
| Structure   | Nested, detailed | Flat, tabular |
| Strength    | Data exchange | Reporting & analysis |
| Weakness    | Harder to read manually | No schema, easy to misinterpret |

---

## Slide 9 â€“ Why Both Matter Here
- Research data arrives in **JSON** (flexible but complex)  
- Reports are needed in **CSV** (clear and shareable)  
- Automating the conversion saves **time and reduces errors**  

---

## Slide 10 â€“ Connecting the Dots
- SCRUM gives us the process â†’ focus on value every sprint  
- JSON/CSV are the technical formats we need to master  
- Together they form a **bridge from raw data to meaningful reports**  

---

## Slide 11 â€“ Wrap-Up
- SCRUM = structure for teamwork  
- JSON = raw research input  
- CSV = clear, accessible output  
- The project proves how **methodology + technol**
